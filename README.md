Introduction:

The obective of this project is to implement the parallax effect for the website development.
inorder to achieve this effect i have created tourism website of a fictional province Kyrat.
the province name is inspired from the MMO, RPG video game "Farcry 4". 
Most of the tourism website uses carousel to showcase the Attraction or landmark.
however carousel is overused and is ineffective for the countries with small territory. (Central Asian countries are prime example)
Parallax effect not only make website attractive, but also make it more simple. 
all the contact information on the footers are dummy and their existence is purely co-incidental.
all the Cities/ District mention in this website are fictional. The images used in this website are taken from h
Himachal pradesh tourism, unsplash and some random website found through Google search 
Images may subject to copyright and without proper permission cannot be used for commercial purpose.
